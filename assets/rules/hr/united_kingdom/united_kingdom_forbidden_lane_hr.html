<h4>Lanes for public transport vehicles</h4><div class=box-rule-content><h4>Bus lanes</h4><div class=box-rule-content><p>Bus lanes may be used by any vehicle designed to carry more than 8 passengers (excluding the driver). Cyclists – and sometimes taxis and two-wheeled motor vehicles – can normally use bus lanes during the times they are operational. Other vehicles must not use bus lanes during the times they are operational, except for loading and unloading (and only if signs alongside the lane do not indicate otherwise).</p><p>Bus lanes are normally signposted with operational times and types of vehicles allowed. If no sign is visible or if no operational times are shown, motorists must assume that the bus lane is operational 24 hours a day.</p><p>Some bus lanes are reserved for local bus services only, which means that tourist coaches, for instance, must not use them. This is normally signposted.</p><p>Examples:</p></div><div class=box-rule-content><div class=box-rule-iconsholder-big><img alt="" src=/internet/ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/images/forbidden-lane-uk.jpg></div><p>Bus lane that can be used by local bus services, bicycles and taxis.

Operational times are shown.</p></div><h4>Heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) on motorways</h4><div class=box-rule-content><p>Drivers of HGVs with a weight exceeding 7.5 tonnes must not drive in the right hand lane of a motorway if there are three or more lanes.</p></div><h4>Cycle lanes</h4><div class=box-rule-content><p>Cycle lanes are shown by road markings and signs. Motorists must not drive or park in a cycle lane marked by a solid white line during its times of operation, which are signposted. Motorists also should not drive or park in a cycle lane marked by a broken white line unless it is unavoidable. Motorists must not park in any cycle lane whilst waiting restrictions apply.</p></div><h4>High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes</h4><div class=box-rule-content><div class=box-rule-iconsholder><img height=33 alt="" width=35 src=/internet/ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/images/forbidden-lane-uk4.jpg></div><p>HOV lanes usually look like a bus lane, with traffic separated by a solid white lane and road markings reading “2+ lane” at regular intervals. They are signposted with the “2+” car symbol.</p></div><h4>Other designated vehicle lanes</h4><div class=box-rule-content><p>Lanes may be restricted for use by particular types of vehicle; these restrictions may apply some or all of the time. The operating times and vehicle types will be indicated on the accompanying traffic signs. Drivers must not drive in such lanes during their times of operation unless signs indicate that their vehicles are permitted.</p></div><p></p>
