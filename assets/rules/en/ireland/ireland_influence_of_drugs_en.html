<p>The current Road Traffic Act (RTA) does not mention any specific drugs and relies on the evidence of impairment of the driver by the police (Garda) and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety Certificate of analysis for the presence of a drug or drugs. The term used in RTA is “intoxicant” and defined as alcohol and drugs and any combination of drugs or of drugs and alcohol. The RTA does not distinguish between illicit drugs and licit drugs which can be prescribed medications or over the counter medications.</p>
<p>The consideration of driving capacity or safety is the core element rather than the legal status of the drug.</p>
<p>Currently the Bureau analyses for the presence of the following drugs or class of drugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cannabinoids</li>
  <li>Opiates</li>
  <li>Benzodiazepines</li>
  <li>Amphetamines</li>
  <li>Metamphetamines</li>
  <li>Cocaine</li>
  <li>Methadone</li>
</ul>
